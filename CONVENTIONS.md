-   Python code must use type annotation in all function signatures, while variable declaration only use type annotation when there is no way to infer its type
-   Do not override a Python variable with a new value that is not its last declared type. Use a new variable with a new type for maximum type predictability

-   In general, prioritize code readability, maintainability and simplicity over fancy short code
-   Do not write functions with more than 4 indentation unless necessary, use your best judgement.
-   One function do its main task as declared in its name, use your best judgement to balance between maintaining a clear one function one task and not to write too small function that is lengthy and confusing to read
-   In general, write code that is clear in its intention and satisfying to read and respect the reader of the code.
